Title: Dungeon Master's Helper
Author: David Colarusso
Description: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Colarusso" target="_blank">@Colarusso</a> built this tool to help him learn D&D. After all, you never learn something as well as when you teach it. So imagine how well you learn something when you teach it to a computer. ;) Also, <a href="https://github.com/colarusso/dm" target="_blank">the code</a> is on GitHub should you want to make edits and craft your own.

<script>
function dice(faces,target){
	number = Math.floor(Math.random()*(faces-1))+1
	if (number<10) {
		number = " "+number+" "
