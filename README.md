# Dungeon Master's Helper

A [web app](https://colarusso.github.io/dm/) Dungeon Masters can use on their phones/computers to help run a game. I built this (am building it) to help me learn the ropes. It walks the user through gameplay, providing content and tips along the way. I wrote it in [QnA Markup](https://www.qnamarkup.org/), and you can see, edit, and test the code in the online editor [here](https://www.qnamarkup.org/?source=https://colarusso.github.io/dm/qna/DnD_QnA.txt). Also, the QnAMarkup source can be found in the `qna` folder. See [https://github.com/colarusso/dm/blob/main/qna/DnD_QnA.txt](https://github.com/colarusso/dm/blob/main/qna/DnD_QnA.txt)

The app can be found at: [https://colarusso.github.io/dm](https://colarusso.github.io/dm)
